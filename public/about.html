<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Yamen Nijim, 20 years old. I was born in Palestine, living currently in Germany. <br />
I moved to Germany in January 2023 to study computer science. <br />
I chose Germany, because it is a great country for studying with high quality of life and with many job opportunities. <br />
I like to do many things throughout the day besides studying, like working out, going to the gym is something which i made a must for me. <br />
I also like to watch movies and football matches, in particular english football. <br />
